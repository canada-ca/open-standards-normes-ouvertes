# Open Standards Guidance

## Definition

A Standard is a document, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.

An Open Standard is a Standard that focuses on development in the spirit of Openness, Transparency, Collaboration and Due Process freely.

### 1. Openness

Central to the definition of an Open Standard is that it requires the standard to be able to be assessed in full by the public and used without constraint.

### 2. Transparency

Open Standards require advance public notice of proposed standardâ€™s development activities, with easily accessible records of decisions and the materials used to come to those decisions. They can have no intentional secrets and must not withhold any detail necessary for implementation.

### 3. Due Process

Decisions are made with impartiality with equity and fairness among participants, where no one party dominates the development of an Open Standard. Any and all impacted or interested parties in Standard are able to contribute to the development of it and feedback is gathered as broadly as possible.

### 4. Collaboration

Open Standards require a respectful collaborative decision-making process that is consensus-based and avoids dependence on any individual supplier or organization.

### 5. Availability

The Government of Canada is committed to Respect for the People and seeks to ensure that Standards adopted by the Government of Canada are free of discrimination against persons or endeavour. As such Open Standards must be freely available to ensure that all Canadian Citizens can make use of them regardless of socioeconomic status.
